# tiptap_images

This is a small proof of concept for uploading images asynchronously to a remote server using tiptap-editor (scrumpy/tiptap).

It is based on a gist from @slava-vishnyakov (https://gist.github.com/slava-vishnyakov/16076dff1a77ddaca93c4bccd4ec4521) as well as the prosemirror [image upload example](https://prosemirror.net/examples/upload/).
