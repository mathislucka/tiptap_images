# tiptap_images

This is a small proof of concept for uploading images asynchronously to a remote server using [tiptap-editor](https://github.com/scrumpy/tiptap).


It is based on a [gist by slava-vishnyakov](https://gist.github.com/slava-vishnyakov/16076dff1a77ddaca93c4bccd4ec4521) as well as the prosemirror [image upload example](https://prosemirror.net/examples/upload/).
